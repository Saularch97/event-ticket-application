# Ticket API - Event Ticketing System

This is the main microservice responsible for managing the ticketing system, including:

- Event creation
- User registration
- Ticket storage
- Communication with recommendation and geolocation services

## üìå System Architecture Overview

The system is designed using a microservices architecture with asynchronous messaging and RESTful synchronous calls for critical operations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Components

- **Ticket API (this project)**: Handles CRUD operations for events, tickets, and users. Stores event location (latitude/longitude).
- **Event Recommendation Service**: Listens for event location data and recommends nearby events based on user location.
- **Geolocation API**: Converts city/address names to latitude and longitude; used when registering events.
- **Cache (Redis)**: Used to cache ticket and recommendation data for performance.
- **Databases**:
    - PostgreSQL: Stores structured ticketing data.
    - NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB): Stores event data optimized for geolocation queries.
- **Messaging Queue**: (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) Used to asynchronously send new event location data to the recommendation service.

## üîÑ Service Communication

- When an event is created, its location is saved and a lightweight message (lat, long, eventId) is sent to the recommendation service via a messaging topic.
- The client can request event recommendations by providing the current latitude and longitude.
- The recommendation service performs a geolocation query and returns nearby events.
