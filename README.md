# Ticket API - Event Ticketing System

This is the main microservice responsible for managing the ticketing system, including:

- Event creation
- User registration
- Ticket storage
- Communication with recommendation and geolocation services

## üìå System Architecture Overview

The system is designed using a microservices architecture with asynchronous messaging and RESTful synchronous calls for critical operations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Components

- **Ticket API (this project)**: Handles CRUD operations for events, tickets, and users. Stores event location (latitude/longitude).
- **Event Recommendation Service**: Listens for event location data and recommends nearby events based on user location.
- **Geolocation API**: Converts city/address names to latitude and longitude; used when registering events.
- **Cache (Redis)**: Used to cache ticket and recommendation data for performance.
- **Databases**:
    - PostgreSQL: Stores structured ticketing data.
    - NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB): Stores event data optimized for geolocation queries.
- **Messaging Queue**: (e.g., Kafka or RabbitMQ) Used to asynchronously send new event location data to the recommendation service.

## üîÑ Service Communication

- When an event is created, its location is saved and a lightweight message (lat, long, eventId) is sent to the recommendation service via a messaging topic.
- The client can request event recommendations by providing the current latitude and longitude.
- The recommendation service performs a geolocation query and returns nearby events.

## ‚úÖ TODO

* [x] Implement **Security Headers** ([https://securityheaders.com/](https://securityheaders.com/))
* [x] Implement some migrations with flyway for versioning the database
* [x] More complex queries using dto's projections, entity manager
* [x] Add http status codes such as 409, 422
* [x] Add @Schemas to request and responses from controllers
* [x] Refactor controller dto's(only use controller dto for request/response)
* [x] Add .env.example and change the jwt authkeys(use .env dependencie)
* [] Verify if cache is working(make unit tests just for the cache)
* [ ] Change integer id's for UUID
* [ ] Treat all the exceptions in the exception global exception handler
* [ ] Improve logging(Add logging functionallity with spring cloud about logs, research about it)
* [ ] Improve permissioning
* [ ] K8s for dev and prod
* [ ] Include role permission in the controllers
* [ ] Use **Virtual Threads** (Project Loom) where applicable
* [ ] Implement Circuit break(Resilience4j)
* [ ] Add **QR code generation** for tickets
* [ ] Add kafka
* [ ] Queue for logs(Kafka or Rabbit)
* [x] Use **Tilt** for local development with Kubernetes
* [ ] Use **Terraform** for infrastructure management
* [x] Events do not have a total number of tickets ‚Äî **implemented**
* [x] Popular events marking ‚Äî updates every hour with the 3 best sellers and caches them
* [x] Implement recommendation service for users based on a given radius
* [x] Add Redis cache for purchase intent
  * [x] Cache user orders lookup
  * [x] Cache popular events marking
  * [x] Cache available tickets per event (availability check)
    üí° **Justification:** Avoids heavy scans on the Ticket table for each visitor.
    üîÑ Cache updates via asynchronous events (when someone buys or cancels).
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Use **proactive invalidation**, not only TTL, since data changes frequently.
* [x] Add Spring Validation (`spring-boot-starter-validation`) for DTOs
* [x] Implement `@RestControllerAdvice` for error handling

* [x] Add **tests** (unit and integration)
* [ ] Refactor tests to reuse some methdos(**dry**)
* [ ] Setup **deployment** pipeline
* [ ] Implement structured **logging** in the application
* [ ] Integrate a **payment method** (e.g., Stripe)

VERY VERY IMPORTANT
* [ ] Change jwt keys and move them to .env file!!!

Useful commands for debbuging in a k8s environment:

Loga o que aconteceu num deploy refereciando o manifesto de deployment:
kubectl logs deployment/booking-deployment

Lista services:
kubectl get svc
